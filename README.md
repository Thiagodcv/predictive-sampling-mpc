# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Neural Network Dynamics
This repository is an implementation of a model-based reinforcement learning agent based off of [1]. The agent uses off-policy training data in order to learn the system dynamics using a neural network. An MPC using a predictive sampling scheme is then used by the agent to determine the optimal action at each timestep within the environment. I've implemented training and evaluation on the Ant-v4 task.
